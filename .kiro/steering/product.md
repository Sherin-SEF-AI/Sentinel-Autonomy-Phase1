# Product Overview

SENTINEL is a contextual safety intelligence platform for vehicles that prevents accidents by understanding both the environment and driver state in real-time.

## Core Capabilities

- **360° Bird's Eye View Perception**: Multi-camera sensor fusion creates a unified top-down view of the vehicle's surroundings
- **Driver Monitoring System**: Tracks driver attention, drowsiness, and distraction through interior camera analysis
- **Contextual Risk Assessment**: Correlates environmental threats with driver awareness to identify situations where the driver may not be aware of critical hazards
- **Intelligent Safety Interventions**: Provides context-aware alerts adapted to driver cognitive load and attention state

## Key Differentiator

Unlike traditional ADAS systems that only monitor the environment, SENTINEL correlates what's happening around the vehicle with whether the driver is actually aware of those threats. This contextual intelligence enables more effective safety interventions by understanding both the hazard and the driver's capacity to respond.

## Target Performance

- Real-time processing at 30+ FPS
- End-to-end latency under 100ms
- Multi-modal alerts (visual, audio, haptic)
- Automatic scenario recording for critical events
